## Hi there 👋 I'm @CodeGraphTheory.

I am an educational resource creator focused on **Graph Computing**, **Compiler Design**, and **Knowledge Representation**. My work bridges the gap between theoretical computer science and practical software engineering, with a special emphasis on:

- **Graph Theory & Algorithms**
- **Graph Databases & Cypher Querying**
- **Graph RAG & Neural Networks**
- **Compiler Optimization & IR**
- **Knowledge Graph Architecture**

I build tools, write guides, and foster community around these transformative technologies.

If you'd like to support my work, give me a follow.
